Verdict: Pass
Reason: In order to calculate the probability of Mary drawing a chip with an even number, both Student A and Student B need to communicate about the total number of chips (9) and how many of them are even numbers (4). Since this information is not explicitly given in either Version A or Version B, the students must collaborate to gather the necessary data and arrive at the correct answer. Working independently without sharing information would likely result in an incorrect solution.
