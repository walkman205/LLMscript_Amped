Verdict: Pass
Reason: In this exercise, Student A will see that 1 block outweighs 8 grams of weights, and Student B will see that 3 blocks are lighter than 20 grams of weights. To determine the weight of one metal block, the students will need to combine their information. Student A can infer that a block is heavier than 8 grams, and Student B can infer that a block is lighter than 20 grams. By discussing and combining these clues, they can deduce the weight of one metal block together. Thus, the collaboration between Student A and Student B is necessary to solve the problem.
