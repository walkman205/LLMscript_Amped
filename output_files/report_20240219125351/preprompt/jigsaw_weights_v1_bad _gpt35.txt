Verdict: pass
Reason: In order to determine the weight of each metal block, Student A and Student B need to collaborate by selecting complementary options from the given list. If, for example, Student A selects to compare one metal block to the 5 gram weight (option c), then Student B would need to select to compare three metal blocks to all weights together (option b) to provide the necessary information for determining the weight of each block. This exercise requires communication and collaboration between the two students to arrive at the solution.
