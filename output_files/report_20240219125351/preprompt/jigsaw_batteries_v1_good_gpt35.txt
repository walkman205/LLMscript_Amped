Verdict: Pass
Reason: In order to determine the best estimate for the total number of faulty batteries produced today, both Student A and Student B need to share the total number of batteries produced that day. Student A knows the sample size and the number of failed batteries in the sample, while Student B has the total number of batteries produced. Therefore, they must collaborate to arrive at the estimated total number of faulty batteries. Working alone, neither Student A nor Student B can determine the total number of faulty batteries accurately without the information provided in the other version.
