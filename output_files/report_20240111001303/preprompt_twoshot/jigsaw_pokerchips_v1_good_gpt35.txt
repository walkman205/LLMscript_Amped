Verdict: pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B. Student A is shown four chips with numbers 1, 2, 6, and 7, while Student B is shown five chips with numbers 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. In order to calculate the probability of drawing a chip with an even number, they need to communicate the numbers on their respective chips and combine the information. Student A needs to know the total number of chips for an accurate calculation, while Student B needs to know the number of even-numbered chips. Thus, collaboration and communication are necessary to solve this problem.
