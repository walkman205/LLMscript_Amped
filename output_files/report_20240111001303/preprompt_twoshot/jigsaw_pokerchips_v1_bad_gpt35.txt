Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Both students are provided with the same visual information, which consists of nine chips labeled 1 through 9. However, they are not given any specific information about the distribution of even and odd numbers on the chips. Therefore, in order to calculate the probability of drawing a chip with an even number, both students need to communicate with each other and share their observations about the distribution of even and odd numbers on their respective chips.
