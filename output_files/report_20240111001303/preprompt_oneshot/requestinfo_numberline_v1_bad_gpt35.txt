Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Each student can select one value from the given list, and then they can communicate their selections to each other. By sharing their selections, they can determine the signs and magnitudes of A and B, which are necessary to find the value of N. Without communication and collaboration, it is not possible for either student to answer the question accurately.
