Reason: In order to answer the question correctly, both Student A and Student B must communicate their respective information. Student A has the highest temperatures for each day, while Student B has the lowest temperatures for each day. By comparing the two sets of data, they can determine the day with the highest difference between the highest and lowest temperatures. Therefore, collaboration is necessary to solve the problem.
