Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Student A knows the average number of boxes sold in each class, but does not know the total number of boxes sold in each class. On the other hand, Student B knows the total number of boxes sold in each class, but does not know the average number of boxes sold in each class. To find the average number of boxes sold by all students in both classes, they need to communicate and share their information with each other.
