Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Both students need to communicate with each other to determine the two numbers that satisfy the given conditions. Since the sum needs to be maximized, the students would need to find the two numbers that are closest to each other while still having a product of 300. This can only be achieved through collaboration and sharing of information between the students.
