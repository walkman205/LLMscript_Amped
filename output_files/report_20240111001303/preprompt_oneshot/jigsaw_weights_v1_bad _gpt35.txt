Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Student A is given Version A, which asks them to make a selection from a list of options. Based on their selection, Student B, who is given Version B, will know which option Student A chose. Student B needs this information to provide the final answer. Therefore, the exercise cannot be solved by either student alone and requires collaboration between the two.
