Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires both Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Student A is given the prompt to enter the time T1, while Student B is given the prompt to enter the time T2. In order to come up with a possible value for T1 and T2, they must communicate with each other to ensure that their times are consistent and make sense in the context of the problem. They cannot answer the question correctly without collaborating and sharing their responses with each other.
