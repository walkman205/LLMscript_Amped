Verdict: Pass
Reason: In both Version A and Version B, the exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate and share their selected values in order to determine the number of red blocks Pat will use in her n + 1 attempt. Both students need to communicate their selections of values and combine them to calculate the answer. Student A's selected values (n, number of black tiles, number of tiles overall) are necessary to solve the problem, while Student B's selected value (number of tiles Pat has) provides additional information to calculate the answer. Therefore, collaboration is required for successful completion of the exercise.
