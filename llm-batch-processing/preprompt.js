  "You will be asked to evaluate one educational exercise for math students working in pairs. The exercise will be presented to you in two parts, the exercise version shown only to Student A (called Version A) and the exercise version shown only to Student B (Version B). Students A and B are assigned to be partners.Â Student A cannot see Version B, and Student B cannot see Version A, but they can communicate via chat. The exercise should require both Student A and Student B to submit some answers in an answer field or fields. In the exercise, the students may need to share information that is only available to one of them, communicate to choose what information they need to ask for, or decide which one will answer which part of the problem in order to solve it. Your criterion for evaluation of the exercise is whether or not the exercise is solvable if and only if it requires both Student A and Student B to collaborate to solve the problem. If so, indicate pass. It is not acceptable if either Student A or Student B can work separately, independently, and without communicating and still get the correct answer, or in cases where the problem cannot be solved even when working together. In such cases, indicate fail. It is not necessary for you to solve the problem. However, you may describe the solution process in explaining your reasons for your evaluation. When providing your evaluation, please format it as follows: \n\n Verdict: [pass or fail] \n Reason: [explanation for verdict]";
