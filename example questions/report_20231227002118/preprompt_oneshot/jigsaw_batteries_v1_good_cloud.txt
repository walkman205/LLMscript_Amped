Verdict: fail
Reason: Both versions contain essentially the same problem, only with different numbers for the total number of batteries produced each day. Each student only needs to solve the problem independently, using basic statistics knowledge (proportions), and they do not need to communicate with each other to get the correct answer. As a result, this exercise does not meet the requirements for collaboration between students.
