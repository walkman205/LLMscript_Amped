Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not require Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Both students are given the same information in their respective versions, and they can independently determine the probability of Mary drawing an even number. For Student A, there are 2 even numbers (2 and 6) out of a total of 4 chips. For Student B, there are 2 even numbers (4 and 8) out of a total of 5 chips. They do not need to communicate with each other to get the correct answer.
