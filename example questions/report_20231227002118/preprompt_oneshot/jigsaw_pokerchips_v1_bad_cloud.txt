Verdict: fail
Reason: In this exercise, both Student A and Student B are given the same information and the same problem to solve. There is no complementary information between the two versions, and both students are presented with the exact same question. They can each calculate the probability of drawing an even number without needing to communicate with each other, as they have the same information. Since students can work independently and still get the correct answer, this exercise does not meet the criterion for collaboration, and thus is evaluated as a fail.
