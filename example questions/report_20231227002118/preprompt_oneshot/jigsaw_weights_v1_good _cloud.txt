Verdict: fail
Reason: In this exercise, both students have the same information and can independently solve the problem without communicating with each other. They can each use the given information about the scale readings to determine the weight of one metal block. In this case, the weight of one metal block for Student A would be 8g and for Student B would be 20-16=4g. Since there's no need for collaboration to solve the problem, the exercise does not meet the requirement for an effective educational exercise for math students working in pairs.
