Verdict: pass
Reason: In order for Student A and Student B to successfully answer this question, they must communicate with each other to coordinate their selections. For example, if Student A chooses "A is positive" and Student B chooses "A is negative," they must discuss and determine which choice to submit. Similarly, if one student selects "A > 1" and the other selects "A is less than or equal to 1," they must communicate to resolve their conflicting selections. Therefore, this exercise requires collaboration between the students to arrive at a correct answer.
