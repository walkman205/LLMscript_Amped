Verdict: pass
Reason: In order to solve this problem, Student A and Student B need to communicate with each other about their selected options and then analyze the possibilities and constraints based on the weight of the metal blocks and the available weights. They cannot determine the weight of the metal blocks by working independently without sharing their selections and discussing their options. The problem requires a collaborative approach to determine the correct answer.
