Verdict: pass
Reason: In order to solve this problem, both Student A and Student B need to communicate and work together. Student A has information about the scale reading in which one block is higher than 8 grams of weights, while Student B has information about the scale reading in which three blocks are lower than 20 grams of weights. By discussing the problem and comparing the two cases, the students can deduce that the weight of one block is 6.67 grams. This requires collaboration and communication between the students, as they cannot find the answer independently.
