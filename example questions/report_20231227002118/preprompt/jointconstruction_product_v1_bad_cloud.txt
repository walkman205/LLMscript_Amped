Verdict: pass
Reason: In this exercise, Student A and Student B are given the same problem to solve, which is to find two numbers whose product is 300 and their sum is maximal. However, they are not given enough information to solve the problem independently. The information is formulated differently for each student, which requires them to collaborate and communicate to find the solution. The collaboration is necessary because the different formulations of the problem may lead to different approaches or solutions. Without sharing their thoughts and solutions, each student would be likely to come up with a different pair of numbers. The exercise effectively requires Student A and Student B to work together and communicate to find the correct answer.
