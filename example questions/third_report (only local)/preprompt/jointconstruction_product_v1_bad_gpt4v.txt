 Verdict: pass
Reason: The exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem, as the information presented in Version A and Version B are complementary. Student A needs to know that the sum of two numbers whose product is 300 must be a multiple of 30, while Student B needs to know that the sum of two numbers whose product is 300 must be a prime number. By communicating with each other via text chat, both students can share this knowledge and work together to find the two numbers that satisfy both conditions. If either student works alone independently, they may not be able to come up with the correct answer, as their approach would be limited by the information available only to them.
