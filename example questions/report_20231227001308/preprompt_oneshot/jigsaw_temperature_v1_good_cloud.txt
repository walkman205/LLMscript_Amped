Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not require collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Both students are given information about the highest and lowest temperatures throughout the week, and they can each independently determine the day with the highest difference between the highest and lowest temperatures by simply looking at the images provided. They do not need to communicate or collaborate to get the correct answer.
