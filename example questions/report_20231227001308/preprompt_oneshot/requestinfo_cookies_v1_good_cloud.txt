Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not meet the requirements for collaboration between Student A and Student B. Both students have access to the same information, and they can independently compute the average number of boxes of cookies sold by all students in both classes. They do not need to communicate with each other to get the correct answer. Each student can select two values from the list and calculate the average on their own. There is no need for them to work together or share information.
