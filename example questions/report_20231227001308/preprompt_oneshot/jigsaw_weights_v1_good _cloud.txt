Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not meet the criterion for collaboration, as both students can solve the problem individually by simply using the given information. For Version A, Student A can simply add the weight of the block to the weight of the 8 grams of weights to determine the weight of one metal block. For Version B, Student B can subtract the weight of the 20 grams of weights from the weight of the blocks to determine the weight of one metal block. They do not need to communicate with each other to solve the problem, and it is possible for both students to get the correct answer independently. Therefore, the exercise does not require collaboration between Student A and Student B, and the verdict is fail.
