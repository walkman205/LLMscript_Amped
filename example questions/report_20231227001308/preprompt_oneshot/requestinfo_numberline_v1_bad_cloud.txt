Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not require collaboration between the two students. Each student only has to make one selection, which can be made independently without any communication between the students. By working independently and knowing the answer to the question proposed by their partner, they can still obtain the correct answer. Consequently, the exercise does not meet the requirements for collaboration.
