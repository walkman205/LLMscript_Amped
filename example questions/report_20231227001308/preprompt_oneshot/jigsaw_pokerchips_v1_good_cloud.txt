Version A:[image of four round chips, labeled 1,2,6, and 7]The chips shown above, as well as the chips shown to your collaboration partner, are placed in a sack and then mixed up. Mary draws one chip from the sack. What is the probability that Mary draws a chip with an even number?Version B:[image of five round chips, labeled 3,4,5,8, and 9]The chips shown above, as well as the chips shown to your collaboration partner, are placed in a sack and then mixed up. Mary draws one chip from the sack. What is the probability that Mary draws a chip with an even number?Reason: This exercise fails the collaboration requirement. Both students have identical information in this exercise, and they can each solve the problem independently without communicating with each other. They simply need to recall the formula for probability: probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes. Since the total outcomes are the same and the number of even-numbered chips is either 1 or 0, the determination of the probability can be made independently by each student.
