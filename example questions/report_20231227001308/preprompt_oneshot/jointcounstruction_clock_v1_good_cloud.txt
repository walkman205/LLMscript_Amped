Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not require Student A and Student B to collaborate to solve the problem. Both students can work independently and still arrive at the correct answer. Student A can simply input any time as T1 (for example, 12:00 AM) and then calculate the time difference between T1 and T2, which should be a multiple of 12:00 minutes (1 hour). Since 600 degrees is equivalent to 10 hours, the difference between T1 and T2 should be 10 hours, or 20 hours in case of T2 being greater than T1. Student B can do the same process, inputting any time as T2 and calculating the time difference between T1 and T2 to be a multiple of 12:00 minutes, then adding or subtracting a multiple of 2 hours to find a time T1 or T2 corresponding to 600 degrees. Both students can arrive at the correct answer without communicating with each other.
