Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise does not require collaboration or communication between the students. Both students A and B can individually determine the solution by considering the different weight combinations. They don't need to share their selections or communicate to find the answer. In fact, they can choose the same option, like compare one metal block to all weights together, and still get the right answer. Since the exercise does not require collaboration, it fails the criteria.
