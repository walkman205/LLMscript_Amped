Verdict: pass
Reason: This exercise meets the requirement because it can only be solved if Student A and Student B share information with each other. Student A and Student B are holding different information: Student A knows the number of black tiles used in the 3x3 and 4x4 patterns but does not know the total number of tiles used in the patterns, while Student B knows the total number of tiles used in the patterns but does not know the number of black tiles used in the 3x3 and 4x4 patterns. They need to communicate this information to each other to make the necessary calculations and provide the correct answer for the number of red blocks Pat will use in her n + 1 attempt.
