Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise fails the requirement because both Student A and Student B can solve the problem independently without the need to communicate or collaborate with the other. Both students are given a simple balance problem with known variables (number of blocks and/or weights) and can deduce the weight of one block by simple subtraction or addition. There is no need for communication or collaboration to solve the problem.
