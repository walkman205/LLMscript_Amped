Verdict: fail
Reason: The exercise does not require collaboration between Student A and Student B as both students can determine the probability of drawing an even number independently. For Version A, Student A simply looks at the chips and sees that there are only two odd numbers (1 and 7), so the probability of drawing an even number is 2/4 = 0.5. Similarly, for Version B, Student B can similarly look at the chips and see that there are three even numbers (3, 4, and 5), so the probability of drawing an even number is 3/5. Both students can compute the probabilities without communicating with each other, and thus the exercise does not meet the requirement for requiring collaboration.
