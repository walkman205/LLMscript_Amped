Verdict: fail
Reason: This exercise fails the requirement since each student can solve the problem without needing to communicate or collaborate with the other. Both students have the same information and can calculate the probability independently. In this case, there are 4 even numbered chips (2, 4, 6, 8) out of 9 chips, so the probability is 4/9 for both students.
