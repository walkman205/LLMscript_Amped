Verdict: fail
Reason: While the students are providing answers based on their respective versions of the exercise, they can still find the answer independently without needing to collaborate. In both versions, the problem requires calculating the faulty battery rate using the sample data and then applying this rate to the total production to estimate the total faulty batteries. This process does not require communication between the students as they can perform calculations with the given information separately.
