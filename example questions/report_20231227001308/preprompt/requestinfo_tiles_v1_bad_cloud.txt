Verdict: pass
Reason: The exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B as they can only make a selection from the given list of values and communicate with each other to answer the question. Since the values are different for each student, they cannot solve it individually and would need to work together and communicate their selections to answer the main question about the number of red blocks in the n + 1 attempt.
