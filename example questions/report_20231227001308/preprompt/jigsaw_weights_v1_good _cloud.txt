Verdict: Pass
Reason: The exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. They need to share the information about the measurements and discuss the weight of the blocks together. Both students' input is necessary to determine the possible weight of one metal block based on the provided information. They cannot work independently and still get the correct answer.
