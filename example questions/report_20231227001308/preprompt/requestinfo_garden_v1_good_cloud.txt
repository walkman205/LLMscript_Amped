Verdict: pass
Reason: In order for both students to answer the question correctly, they need to collaborate and communicate with each other. Without communication, it would be impossible to know which information is relevant and which is not. For example, if Student A selects the area of one of the shaded parts of the garden and Student B selects the dimensions of the path or the length of X, their individual answers may not be accurate. However, by discussing the options and combining their selections, the students can come up with the correct answer.
