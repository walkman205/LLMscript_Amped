Verdict: pass
Reason: For each student to successfully answer the question, they need to collaborate through communication. Each student can only provide one piece of information about the variables A or B, and the other student needs this information to determine the sign and magnitude of A and B. For example, Student A selects "positive A" and "greater than 1" while Student B selects "negative B" and "greater than 1". By sharing their selections, they can deduce that A is positive and greater than 1 while B is negative and greater than 1, which would result in a product N that is positive and greater than 1. This scenario requires both students to be involved in the problem-solving process, making it a collaborative exercise.
