Verdict: pass
Reason: In order to find the average number of boxes of cookies sold by all students in both classes, the students need to collaborate and make selections from the given list of values. Neither student A nor student B has enough information to solve the problem independently. The students need to communicate and share their selections to determine the total number of boxes of cookies sold and the total number of students in both classes, which is required to calculate the average. Therefore, this exercise requires collaboration between student A and student B.
