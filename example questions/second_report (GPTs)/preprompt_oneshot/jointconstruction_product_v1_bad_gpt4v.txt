 Verdict: fail

Reason: This exercise does not require Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Both of them can find the solution independently by calculating all possible pairs of numbers whose product is 300 and finding the pair with the maximum sum. Therefore, it is possible for both students to answer correctly by working alone and independently.
