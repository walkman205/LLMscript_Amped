 Verdict: Pass
Reason: The exercise requires Student A and Student B to work together and compare the information presented in their respective versions of the exercise. They need to analyze both figures, find the days with the highest and lowest temperatures for each figure, and determine which day has the highest difference between the two temperatures. Since they cannot see each other's figure, they must communicate this information through text chat, collaborating on finding the answer. This exercise cannot be solved independently by either Student A or Student B, as they need to compare and analyze the information presented in their respective versions.
