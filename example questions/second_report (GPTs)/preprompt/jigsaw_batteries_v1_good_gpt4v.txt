Reason: Both versions require Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. The main difference between Version A and Version B lies in the magnitude of the production line, but the core idea remains the same - drawing a sample from a larger population can provide a better estimate of the population size. In both cases, the students need to communicate with each other in order to arrive at the best estimate based on the information provided.
