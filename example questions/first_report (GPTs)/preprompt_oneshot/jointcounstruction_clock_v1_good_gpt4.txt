Verdict: Fail

Reason: This exercise does not meet the requirement because Student A and Student B are both provided with the same information regarding the rotation of the minute hand. Given that a full rotation on the clock (360 degrees) represents an hour, both students can individually calculate that the 600 degrees rotation represents one hour and forty minutes. Therefore, both students could individually choose an arbitrary start time (T1 for Student A, T2 for Student B) and calculate the end time (or start time for the other student) by adding one hour and forty minutes to the chosen start time. They do not need to communicate or collaborate to determine the times T1 and T2.
