Verdict: Pass

Reason: The exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B. Since each student can make only one selection from the list of options, they must communicate their choice and the result of their comparison with their partner to solve the problem. Thus, the exercise successfully requires both students to collaborate. It is impossible for one student to find the weight of the metal block independently using only their data. They need the information from their partner's selection and comparison result to determine the weight of the metal block.
