Verdict: Pass
Reason: In order to solve this problem, Student A and Student B need to communicate their selections with each other. Student A needs to select options C and F, while Student B needs to select options A and D. Then, Student A can calculate the average number of boxes sold by multiplying option C (average number of boxes sold in class A) by option F (total number of students in class A) and adding it to the product of option A (average number of boxes sold in class B) and option G (total number of students in class B). Finally, they can divide the result by the sum of option F and option G to find the average number of boxes sold by all students in both classes. Similarly, Student B can calculate the average using the selections made. Therefore, collaboration is necessary to find the correct answer.
