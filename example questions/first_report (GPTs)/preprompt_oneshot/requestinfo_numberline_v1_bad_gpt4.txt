Verdict: Pass
Reason: For this exercise, the students need to select one option each from the list, resulting in a combined total of two pieces of information. Without knowing what the other has chosen, each student alone only has partial information and won't be able to deduce the solution completely. For example, if student A selects option a) and gets to know whether 'A' is positive or negative and student B chooses option d) and finds out whether 'B' is greater than 1. They both need to communicate what they know to each other in order to predict the outcome of the number 'N'. Without sharing this information they can only make assumptions. Thus, this exercise encourages collaborative communication between the students.
