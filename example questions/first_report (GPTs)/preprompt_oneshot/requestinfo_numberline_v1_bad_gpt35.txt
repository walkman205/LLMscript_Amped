Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Each student can make one selection from the given list of values, and the values they choose will be revealed to them. Student A may choose whether A is positive or negative, and Student B may choose whether B is positive or negative. To find the best estimate for the number N, they need to communicate their selections to each other and use the product of their selections to provide their final answer. Without collaboration, it is impossible to determine the values of A and B and therefore calculate the value of N.
