Verdict: Pass

Reason: The exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Neither student can select all necessary information pieces from the provided list because they are limited to selecting one piece each. Therefore, in order to determine the area of the shaded portion, they are required to communicate their selected information. For example, one student might select the dimensions of the path while the other selects the length of X, and they would then need to share this information and use it collaboratively to answer the question.
