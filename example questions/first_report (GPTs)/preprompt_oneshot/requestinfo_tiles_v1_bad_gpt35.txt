Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Student A and Student B are assigned different sets of values to select from (e.g., one selects the value for "n" and the other selects the value for "c"). They need to communicate their selected values to each other to calculate the number of red blocks in the n + 1 attempt. Therefore, they must work together to arrive at the correct answer.
