Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B. Student A is given Version A, which prompts them to select one option from the list (a, b, c, or d). Student B is given Version B, which is identical to Version A. In order to determine the weight of each metal block, Student A needs to know the selection made by Student B, and vice versa. For example, if Student A selects option a) and Student B selects option c), they can collaborate and deduce that the weight of each metal block is 3 grams. Thus, the exercise cannot be solved by one student alone and requires collaboration between Student A and Student B.
