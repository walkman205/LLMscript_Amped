Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to solve the problem. Student A is given the diagram of the garden and the white area represents a rectangular path going through the garden. They need to select one value that they believe is necessary to find the area of the shaded portion of the garden. Student B is given the same diagram and information and has to select a different value from the list. In order to find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, both students need to communicate and share their selected values to combine the necessary information. For example, if Student A selects the length of X and Student B selects the length of Y, they can then compute the area of the shaded portion by subtracting the area of the path from the total area of the garden, using the dimensions they each selected.
