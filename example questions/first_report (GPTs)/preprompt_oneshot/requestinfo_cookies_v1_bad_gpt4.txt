Verdict: Pass

Reason: In order to calculate the average number of boxes sold by all students, students A and B need to select different pieces of information. For instance, if student A chooses "Average number of boxes of cookies sold in class A" and "Total number of boxes of cookies sold in class A" and student B chooses "Average number of boxes of cookies sold in class B" and "Total number of cookies per box", they would need to share the information obtained in order to calculate the overall average. Students A and B will need to communicate and work collaboratively to solve the problem, thus, this exercise makes it impossible for the students to answer correctly by working alone independently.
