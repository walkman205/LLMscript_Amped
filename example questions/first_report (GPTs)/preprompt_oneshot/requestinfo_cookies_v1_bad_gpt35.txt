Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B. Student A has access to the average number of boxes of cookies sold in class A and the total number of cookies per box, while Student B has access to the average number of boxes of cookies sold in class B and the total number of students in class A. In order to calculate the average number of boxes of cookies sold by all students in both classes, Student A needs to share the average number of boxes sold in class A with Student B, and Student B needs to share the average number of boxes sold in class B with Student A. With this shared information, they can then multiply the average number of boxes sold in each class by the total number of students in class A and sum the two results to find the average number of boxes sold by all students in both classes.
