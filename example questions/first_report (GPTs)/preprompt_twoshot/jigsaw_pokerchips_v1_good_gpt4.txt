Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires the students to collaborate in order to solve the problem, as the number and labels of the chips known to each student are different and complementary. To solve the problem, the total number of even chips and the overall total number of chips must be known. Student A knows that there are 2 even numbers among 4 chips from their own set (2 and 6), while student B knows that there are 2 even numbers among 5 chips in their own set (4 and 8). They have to share this information with each other to find out the total number of even chips and total number of chips. Only then can they calculate the probability of Mary drawing a chip with an even number. Therefore, it's impossible for students to answer correctly if they work independently and do not communicate with each other.
