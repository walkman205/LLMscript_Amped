Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires communication and collaboration between Student A and Student B in order to solve the problem. Student A sees a diagram of the garden with the white stripe representing the path and is asked what information is needed to find the area of the shaded portion of the garden. Student B sees the same diagram and has the same question. Each student is allowed to make one selection from a list of values and then the selections are revealed to both students. In order to find the area of the shaded portion, the students need to share their selections and discuss which information is needed. They need to work together to determine if the area of one of the shaded parts, dimensions of the path, length of X, or length of Y is the necessary information. Collaboration is required to solve the problem, which makes this exercise pass.
