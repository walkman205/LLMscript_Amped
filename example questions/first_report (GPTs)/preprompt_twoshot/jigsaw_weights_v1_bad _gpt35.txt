Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to solve the problem. Student A has access to Version A which allows them to make a selection from the given options, and Student B has access to Version B which also allows them to make a selection. Both students have information that is necessary to determine the weight of each metal block. However, they need to communicate their selections to each other in order to combine the information and solve the problem. For example, if Student A selects option c) and Student B selects option b), they can determine the weight of each metal block by comparing one metal block to the 5 gram weight and then comparing the remaining two metal blocks to all weights together. Therefore, collaboration is required to arrive at the correct answer.
