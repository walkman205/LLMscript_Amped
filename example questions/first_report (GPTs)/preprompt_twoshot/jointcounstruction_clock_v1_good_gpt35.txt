Verdict: Pass

Reason: In order to solve this exercise, Student A needs to determine the value of T1 (the starting time) and Student B needs to determine the value of T2 (the ending time). They cannot solve the problem independently since each version only provides information about one of the times. Therefore, they must collaborate by sharing their time values with each other to determine a possible solution. For example, if Student A enters 12:00 PM as T1, Student B will need to enter 2:00 PM as T2 since the minute hand turns 600 degrees in 2 hours.
