Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise passes the requirement as it necessitates communication between both parties. Student A and B get to select only one value each. To determine the characteristic of number N (i.e., whether it's negative or positive, less than, equal to, or greater than 1), they need the selections made by both parties. Without communicating their selected values, they can't determine the nature of N.
