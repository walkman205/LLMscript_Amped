Verdict: Pass 
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration because Student A has information about the chips labeled 1, 2, 6, and 7, while Student B has information about the chips labeled 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Neither student has all the information needed to calculate the probability of drawing a chip with an even number, so they need to communicate and share their information in order to solve the problem.
