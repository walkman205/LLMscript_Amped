Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B to determine the possible values of A and B and to find the best estimate for the number N. Each student can select one value from the given options and share it with their partner. By combining the information, they can narrow down the possibilities for A and B and make an educated guess for the value of N. The exercise cannot be successfully solved without communication and collaboration between the two students.
