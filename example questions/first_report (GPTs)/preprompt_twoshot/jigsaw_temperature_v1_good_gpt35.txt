Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B as they are provided with different information. Student A is given the highest temperatures measured each day, while Student B is given the lowest temperatures measured each day. In order to determine which day had the highest difference between the highest and lowest temperatures, Student A and Student B need to communicate with each other and share their respective information. They need to compare the highest and lowest temperatures for each day and collaborate to identify the day with the highest temperature difference. Thus, collaboration is necessary to solve this exercise.
