Verdict: Fail

Reason: This exercise fails the requirement as each student can solve the problem without needing to communicate or collaborate with one another. Both students can individually determine the probability of drawing an even-numbered chip from their own set of nine chips. The exercise is presented in the same way to both students, meaning that they have all the necessary information to answer the question without needing to talk to each other about their individual exercises.
