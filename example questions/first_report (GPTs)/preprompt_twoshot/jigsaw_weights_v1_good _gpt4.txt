Verdict: Pass 

Reason: This exercise passes the requirement because both students A and B are required to share their information for them to solve the problem. Student A has information that shows one block is lighter than 8 grams while student B has information that shows the combined weight of the blocks is more than 20 grams. They need to communicate this information with each other to estimate the weight of one block.
