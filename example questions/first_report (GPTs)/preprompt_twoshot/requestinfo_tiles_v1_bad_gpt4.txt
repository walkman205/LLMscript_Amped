Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise does require collaboration between Student A and Student B. Although the initial problem is the same for both, the question is constructed such that different pieces of information(a, b, c or d) are needed to solve the problem, and students can only select one of these pieces. As a result, both students must share their selected piece of information in order to answer the question correctly. Notably, the rule of the tile pattern used by Pat, which can be deduced based on the images and the selected information, is essential to calculate the number of red blocks in the (n+1)th pattern. This implies that both students must fully understand and discuss the pattern rule together. Thus, this exercise fosters team problem solving and collaborative learning processes.
