Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires student A and student B to collaborate in order to reach a solution. For instance, to calculate the average number of boxes sold by all students in both classes, they would need to know the total number of boxes sold in both classes and the total number of students in both classes. However, the given information is distributed between the two versions such that neither student can answer the question by themselves. For instance, if Student A selects options A (Average number of boxes sold in class A) and E (Total number of students in class A), and Student B selects options B (Total number of boxes sold in class A) and C (Average number of boxes sold in class B), they would need to exchange this information to calculate the total number of boxes sold in both classes and the total number of students in both classes. Therefore, collaboration and communication between the students is necessary to solve the problem.
