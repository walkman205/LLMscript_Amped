Verdict: Fail
Reason: Both Student A and Student B are provided with the exact same options, which allows them to select all necessary information independently. Solving for the average number of boxes sold by all students in both classes requires the total number of boxes sold in both classes (option B times option E from one class and presumably the same numbers for the other class) and the total number of students in both classes. The problem does not specify that unique options must be chosen between the two students, so one student could choose the four necessary pieces of information (options B, C, E and presumably the total number of students in class B if it were offered) individually, solve the problem independently, and then both could answer correctly without communicating.
