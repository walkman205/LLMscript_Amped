Verdict: Pass

Reason: In order to solve the problem, Student A and Student B will need to collaborate by each selecting one value from the given list. This means they need to communicate with each other to ensure they do not select the same value. Once they have both made their selections, they can use the information revealed to them to determine the answer to the question. The collaboration and communication required between the two students make it impossible for them to answer the question correctly by working independently.
