Version B:

Verdict: Pass

Reason: To answer this question correctly, the students would need to understand and discuss the best pairs of selections to make, as there is a restriction on the number of selections they can each make. They would need to get the Total number of boxes sold in each class (Option B and D), as well as the Total number of students in each class (Option F and G) from this selection. This would require their collaboration. If they made selections independently, they might not end up with the information required to calculate the total average number of boxes sold and thus would fail to answer the question correctly. This exercise effectively encourages collaboration between Student A and Student B.
