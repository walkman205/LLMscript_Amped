Verdict: Pass

Reason: Based on the instructions for this exercise, Student A and Student B have to choose one piece of information independently to reveal about numbers A and B. Given that the information they can choose ranges from the nature of A and B (positive or negative) to their size (>1 or not), neither student alone can determine the value of N (product of A and B) without collaborating. The students must communicate with each other, share the details they have obtained, and together solve the problem. Without this cooperation, it's impossible to find out the nature of N solely based on either Version A or Version B.
