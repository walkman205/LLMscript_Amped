Verdict: Fail

Reason: Both versions of the exercise are duplicate - A and B are given the same information. Each student has all the information needed to solve the question: there are 9 chips with labels from 1-9. With this, both Student A and Student B can individually count the number of even numbers (4) and the total number of chips (9) to determine the probability of picking an even number, with no need for collaboration or communication with their partner. Therefore, the exercise fails to necessitate collaboration between the two students.
