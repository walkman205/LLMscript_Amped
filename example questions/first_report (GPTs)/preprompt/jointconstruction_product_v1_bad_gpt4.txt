Verdict: Fail

Reason: Both versions A and B of the exercise present the students with the same task and information. They do not need to exchange any complementary information to solve the problem since they can both work out the solution independently from the same premise. Therefore, the task does not seem to necessitate collaboration between students A and B, which is why the exercise fails.
