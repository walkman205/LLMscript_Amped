Verdict: Pass
Reason: The exercise requires Student A and Student B to collaborate in order to determine the weight of one metal block. Student A has information about the scale with one block and 8 grams of weights, while Student B has information about the scale with three blocks and 20 grams of weights. By communicating with each other, they can compare the two situations and figure out the weight of one metal block. Student A can explain that the block on the scale is higher, indicating that one block must be heavier than 8 grams. Student B can explain that the blocks on the scale are lighter, indicating that one block must be lighter than 20 grams. By combining this information, they can deduce the weight of one metal block.
