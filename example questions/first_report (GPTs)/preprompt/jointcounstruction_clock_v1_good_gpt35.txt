Verdict: Pass
Reason: This exercise requires collaboration between Student A and Student B. In order to solve the problem, Student A needs to determine a value for T1 and communicate it to Student B, who will then determine a value for T2 and provide it to Student A. The students cannot solve this problem independently without communicating because they need to coordinate their answers to ensure that the minute hand turns 600 degrees between the two times.
