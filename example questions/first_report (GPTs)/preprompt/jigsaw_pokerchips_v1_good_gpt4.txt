Verdict: Pass

Reason: To correctly answer the question about the probability of drawing an even-numbered chip, Student A needs to know how many chips Student B has and how many of those are even-numbered. Meanwhile, Student B similarly needs to know how many chips Student A has and how many of those are even-numbered. Neither student can answer accurately without this information. This means that they are required to communicate and share information about their own version of the exercise to the other. Therefore, the activity cannot be successfully completed independently by each student without communication. Hence, this fits the criteria for a successful collaborative pair exercise.
