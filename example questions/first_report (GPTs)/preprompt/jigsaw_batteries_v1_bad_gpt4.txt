Verdict: Fail
Reason: Both version A and version B of the exercise present the exact same problem to Student A and Student B. They are both asked to estimate the total number of faulty batteries based on given data. There is no unique, complementary, or differing information that would require them to communicate and collaborate in order to reach a solution. Therefore, they could each solve the problem independently, thus failing the criterion of this evaluation.
