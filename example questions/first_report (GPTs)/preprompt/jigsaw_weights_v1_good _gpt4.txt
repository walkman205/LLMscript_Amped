Verdict: Pass

Reason: This exercise requires both Student A and Student B to share the information presented in their respective versions in order to determine the weight of a single metal block. From Student A's version, the weight of one block is less than 8 grams. From Student B's version, the weight of three blocks is less than 20 grams. They both need to communicate this information and could then figure out that each block weighs less than 8 grams, but more than 20/3 grams (about 6.67 grams), to find a possible weight. It's only through combining both pieces of information can they deduce a possible weight of one metal block. Therefore, it is impossible for the students to answer correctly by working alone independently and thus the exercise passes the evaluation.
