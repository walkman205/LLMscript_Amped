Verdict: Pass

Reason: In order to determine the weight of each metal block, both Student A and Student B need to communicate and share the information they have selected from the list. By comparing their selected options, they can deduce the correct method to use and collaborate to find the weight of each metal block. This requires active communication between the two students, validating the exercise's collaborative nature.
