Verdict: Pass

Reason: In both Version A and Version B, the students are provided with a diagram of a rectangular garden with a white path going through it. They are then asked what information they would need to find the area of the shaded portion of the garden. Each student is allowed to select one option from a provided list of values.

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, both students would need to communicate and share their selected options. If Student A selects option b) (the dimensions of the path) and Student B selects option c) (the length of X), they can work together to find the area of the shaded portion. Student A can use the dimensions of the path to calculate the area of the entire garden, and then subtract the area of the path to find the area of the shaded portion. However, if either student works independently and selects an option that is not complementary to their partner's selection, they would not be able to find the area of the shaded portion accurately.

Therefore, collaboration between Student A and Student B is required to solve the problem, making this exercise pass the criterion for evaluation.
