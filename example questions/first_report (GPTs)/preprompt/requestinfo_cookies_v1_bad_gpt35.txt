Verdict: Pass
Reason: To solve this problem, Student A and Student B need to collaborate and share information. Student A needs to select either the average number of boxes of cookies sold in class A or the total number of boxes of cookies sold in class A, and Student B needs to select either the average number of boxes of cookies sold in class B or the total number of cookies per box. Once they both make their selections, they can add the values together and divide by the total number of students in class A and class B in order to get the average number of boxes of cookies sold by all students in both classes. Each student's selection is necessary to calculate the final answer, making collaboration between the students essential.
